# PowerShell

I have completed the PowerShell course on TryHackMe . I learned various PowerShell commands, including how to check for user accounts, collect basic networking details, manage scheduled tasks, and write scripts. I am currently documenting my learning.

PowerShell is a scripting language and shell environment for Windows, developed on the .NET framework. It allows users to automate and manage various tasks through cmdlets â€” specialized commands that follow a verb-noun format, such as Get-Process.
